1. Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are the most basic data types built into the Java language. They are not objects and represent single values. Java defines eight primitive data types, each with its own size and purpose:

Data Type	Size (in bytes)	Range	Description
byte	1	-128 to 127	8-bit signed integer
short	2	-32,768 to 32,767	16-bit signed integer
int	4	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647	32-bit signed integer
long	8	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807	64-bit signed integer
float	4	±1.4E−45 to ±3.4028235E38	Single-precision 32-bit floating point
double	8	±4.9E−324 to ±1.7976931348623157E308	Double-precision 64-bit floating point
char	2	0 to 65,535	Single 16-bit Unicode character
boolean	1 (not precisely defined)	true or false	Represents one of two values: true or false
Characteristics of Primitive Data Types:
Memory Efficiency: They are stored directly in memory, which makes them efficient in terms of space.
Fixed Size: Each primitive data type has a fixed size and range.
No Methods: Primitive types do not have methods associated with them.
2. Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types, also known as reference data types, are more complex than primitive types. They are derived from primitive types and can store multiple values or objects. Some examples include:

Classes: User-defined data types created using the class keyword. For example, a Car class can be defined to represent car objects.

Interfaces: A reference type in Java that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields and cannot be instantiated.

Arrays: A collection of similar types of elements. For example, int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}; creates an array of integers.

Strings: Although String is a class in Java, it is widely used to represent text data. Strings are immutable sequences of characters.

Characteristics of Non-Primitive Data Types:
Memory Reference: Non-primitive types store a reference (address) to the memory location where the actual data is held, rather than the data itself.
Flexible Size: They can grow or shrink in size (like arrays) or can hold various forms of data (like classes).
Methods and Attributes: Non-primitive types can have methods and attributes associated with them, allowing for more complex data manipulation.
Summary
Primitive Data Types:

Represent single values.
Are predefined by the language.
Have fixed sizes and ranges.
Are stored in the stack memory.
Non-Primitive Data Types:

Represent objects or collections of values.
Are user-defined or derived from classes.
Have flexible sizes.
Are stored in the heap memory.
